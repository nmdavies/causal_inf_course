# Causal Inference Course NTNU
Files for the NTNU causal inference course

The files for the causal inference course can be found here. I'll post additional code for the following lectures. 

<b>Lecture 1: An introduction to causal inference</b>

The first file illustrates bias due to confounding, and the second illustrates bias due to selection/collider bias. These simulations can be modified to understand how different analytic techinques are affected by these biases. 

The video of the first lecture is <a href="https://ntnu.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=73fb0897-2b58-497a-87f7-ac3800aa01ec">here</a>. Apologies, the first 5 mins are missing, but this is just provides a bit of background and motivation for the use of causal inference methods. 

The presentation for the first lecture is <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/raw/main/lecture_1_intro_causal_inf.pptx">here</a>.

The first simulation on confounding bias is <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/main/reg_1_confounding.do">here</a>.

The second simualtion on selection bias is  <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/main/reg_2_selection_collider_bias.do">here</a>.

<b>Lecture 2: The principals of instrumental variable analysis</b>

The second lecture describes how to define an instrumental variable and how to run an instrumental variable analysis. 

The video of the first lecture is <a href="https://ntnu.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b19c2912-54a6-4867-ac0d-ac7000915914">here</a>. 

The presentation for the second lecture is <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/raw/main/lecture_2_principals_of_iv_analysis.pptx">here</a>.

I've posted <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/raw/main/iv_practical_2020_nmd_201106.docx">a short tutorial</a>  with <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/raw/iv_practical_2020.dta">datasets</a> and an example <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/main/reg_1_code_iv_practical.do">script</a> here. I've provided Stata code, but I would be very happy to provide R code as well if people would like. 

The video of the second lecture will be posted <a href="https://ntnu.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/tba">here</a>.
