# Causal Inference Course NTNU
Files for the NTNU causal inference course

The files for the causal inference course can be found here. I'll post additional code for the following lectures. 

The first file illustrates bias due to confounding, and the second illustrates bias due to selection/collider bias. These simulations can be modified to understand how different analytic techinques are affected by these biases. 

The video of the first presentation is <a href="https://ntnu.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=73fb0897-2b58-497a-87f7-ac3800aa01ec">here</a>. Apologies, the first 5 mins are missing, but this is just provides a bit of background and motivation for the use of causal inference methods. 

The presentation for the first lecture is <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/raw/main/lecture_1_intro_causal_inf.pptx">here</a>.

The first simulation on confounding bias is <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/main/reg_1_confounding.do">here</a>.

The second simualtion on selection bias is  <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/main/reg_2_selection_collider_bias.do">here</a>.

Please send comments and suggestions to neil.davies@bristol.ac.uk.
