Files for the causal inference course

The files for the causal inference course can be found here. I'll post additional code for the following lectures. 

The first file illustrates bias due to confounding, and the second illustrates bias due to selection/collider bias. These simulations can be modified to understand how different analytic techinques are affected by these biases. 

The presentation for the first lecture is here <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/raw/main/lecture_1_intro_causal_inf.pptx">here</a>.

The first simulation on confounding bias can be seen <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/main/reg_1_confounding.do">here</a>.

The second simualtion on selection bias can be see  <a href="https://github.com/nmdavies/causal_inf_course/blob/main/reg_2_selection_collider_bias.do">here</a>.

Please send comments and suggestions to neil.davies@bristol.ac.uk.
